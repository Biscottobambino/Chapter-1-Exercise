CHAPTER 5, EXERCISE 2 - GLOSSARY 

A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store
their meanings as values.

Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print
the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between

each word-meaning pair in your output.

#Make glossary, and the values are its meaning 
glos= {'List': 'Lists are ordered collections and intercangable set of data. ', 'Loop': 'repeating statements until condition is satisfied.', 'Operators': 'Special symbols that change the outcome of data.', 'Conditional statements': 'They control the flow of information in a data set.',}

#displaying their calues according to the list 
print("lists -", glos['List'])
print("Loops -",glos['Loop'])
print("Operators -",glos['Operators'])
print("Conditional statements -",glos['Conditional statements'])

#Output
"""

lists - Lists are ordered collections and intercangable set of data. 
Loops - repeating statements until condition is satisfied.
Operators - Special symbols that change the outcome of data.
Conditional statements - They control the flow of information in a data set.
